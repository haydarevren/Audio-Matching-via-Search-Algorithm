# Audio-Matching-via-Search-Algorithm

Imagine that, you’re in your car, listening to the radio and suddenly you hear a song that catches your attention. It’s the best new song you have heard for a long time, but you missed the announcement and don’t recognize the artist. Still, you would like to know more about this music. If you can record the song, you can find its name thanks to our engine.

What about mixes? You have heard a song that is created as a mix of several songs and you want to know that which songs are mixed. Our search engine can find those songs in several seconds.

Audio matching is often regarded as identification problems where an unknown audio segment is matched to a large audio database.

In principle, the problem can be approached using deterministic methods such as correlation and template matching. However there are also certain limitations. First of all, the computational cost in these methods is quite high in audio applications.

Way to reduce computational complexity and the number of data is working on a feature space instead of working directly on audio data.

A source of difficulty when automatically identifying audio content derives from its high dimensionality, the significant variance of the audio data for perceptually similar content and the necessity to efficiently compare the fingerprint with a huge collection of registered fingerprints.

An audio fingerprint is a compact content-based signature that summarizes an audio recording.

Audio fingerprinting extract characteristics of a piece of audio content and store them in a database. When presented with an unidentified piece of audio content, characteristics of that piece are calculated and matched against those stored in the database. 

Using fingerprints and matching algorithms, distorted versions of a single recording can be identified as the same music title.
